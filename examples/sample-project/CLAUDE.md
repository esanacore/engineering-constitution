# CLAUDE.md

This sample project follows Eric's Engineering Constitution.

Read `AGENTS.md` and the documents in `constitution/` before making changes.

Check `docs/SESSION_PLAN.md` for a previous interrupted session and write your own plan there before implementing. Read `docs/MEMORY.md` for project memory, and propose any new learnings, preferences, or decisions to the user before recording them there. End every push with a Next Steps procedure (`constitution/AI_WORKFLOW.md`, "Next Steps Procedure"): a numbered checklist of what happens next, each step tagged **HUMAN**, **AGENT**, or **AUTOMATED**, with every step only a person can do (hardware, credentials, approvals) called out and described; put it in the pull request and `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

Keep the demo page current — when a change alters user-facing behavior and the repository has a `demo.html`, update it in the same change; a demo still showing the old behavior is an incomplete change (`constitution/DOCUMENTATION.md`, "Demo Page").

Consult and extend the session log — before planning, read the newest rows of `docs/sessions/README.md` and search `docs/sessions/` for earlier sessions on the same topic (`bash constitution/scripts/find_sessions.sh <keyword>`), reading the ones that match; before completing work, add this session's summary there (request, context, decisions, discoveries, outcome — a summary, never a transcript, and never a secret) and list it in the index (`constitution/AI_WORKFLOW.md`, "Session Summaries").
